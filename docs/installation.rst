Installation
============


Stable release
--------------

NOTE: This will not work! This project is pending a rename because "aina"
is not available on PyPI. Looking for suggestions at https://github.com/iLoveTux/aina/issues/4

To install aina, run this command in your terminal:

.. code-block:: console

    $ pip install aina

This is the preferred method to install aina, as it will always install the most recent stable release.

If you don't have `pip`_ installed, this `Python installation guide`_ can guide
you through the process.

From sources
------------

The sources for aina can be downloaded from the `Github repo`_.

You can either clone the public repository:

.. code-block:: console

    $ git clone git://github.com/ilovetux/aina

Or download the `tarball`_:

.. code-block:: console

    $ curl  -OL https://github.com/ilovetux/aina/tarball/master

Once you have a copy of the source, you can install it with:

.. code-block:: console

    $ python setup.py install


.. _Github repo: https://github.com/ilovetux/aina
.. _tarball: https://github.com/ilovetux/aina/tarball/master
